			<p>Turbulence can be defined as 'bumpiness in flight'. Turbulence in an aircraft may cause you to be uncomfortable, but is not dangerous. You can think of it as a comfort or service issue. Aircraft today are built to handle all levels of extreme turbulence, proven by the fact that there have been no aircraft accidents due to turbulence in over 50 years. All injuries that are caused by turbulence are attributed to passengers or crew not wearing their seat belts.</p>
<p>There are several types of turbulence that include: mechanical turbulence, wake turbulence, turbulence around thunderstorms and clear air turbulence (CAT).</p>
<p><strong>Mechanical Turbulence</strong></p>
<p>Mechanical turbulence occurs close to the ground when solid objects such as mountains, trees or buildings block the flow of air. As the wind is redirected around the obstructions, it slows down. It is this difference between the slower moving and the faster-moving air above that creates a circulation of air leading to turbulence. The positive aspect of this kind of turbulence is that you can quickly climb or descend through it so it usually doesn't last very long.</p>
<p><strong>Turbulence and Thunderstorms</strong></p>
<p>As the name suggests, this type of turbulence occurs in and around clouds of extensive vertical development (meaning an excessive rise of heat). These types of clouds are growing and becoming unstable by nature that contain updrafts and downdrafts. They start out as puffy white clouds (cumulus) and in the right atmospheric conditions can grow to become thunderstorms. Pilots can predict where these will build and can see them either visually, or with the aircraft weather radar. Pilots make sure the aircraft is always well separated from any thunderstorms.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Air Turbulence</strong></p>
<p>Clear Air turbulence, or CAT as we call it, usually occurs near or around a jet stream (a narrow band of high-speed winds in the atmosphere that reaches its greatest speed between 24,000-50,000ft). This altitude may correspond to the cruising altitude of an airliner. It's the rapid change in wind speed around the jet stream that causes CAT. Global warming is contributing to an increase in the occurrence of CAT, which is a nuisance for us, but still far from danger. In some cases, it can be difficult to predict (this is why most airlines encourage passengers to keep their seat belt fastened even if the seat belt sign is off); however, pilots share any occurrences of CAT with Air Traffic Control, who will then pass it on to all other aircraft in the area.</p>
<p><strong>Wake Turbulence</strong></p>
<p>Wake turbulence occurs when an airplane flies into the wake vortices of an aircraft ahead. These vortices are like waves that are generated by the aircraft ahead. This scenario is similar to a larger ship traveling in front of a smaller ship. The waves produced by the larger ship will cause a bumpy ride if following too close. Same scenario with an aircraft where smaller aircraft who are following a larger aircraft are always kept further back in distance to allow the vortices to dissipate. Airliners are adequately spaced on approach to avoid and minimize this kind of turbulence.</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Turbulence</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1st:LIGHT-Occupants may feel a slight strain against seat belts or shoulder straps. Unsecured objects may be displaced slightly. Food service may be conducted, and little or no difficulty is encountered in walking.</p>
  <p>2nd:MODERATE-Occupants feel definite strains against seat belts or shoulder straps. Unsecured objects will be possibly bounced around. Food service and walking will be difficult.</p>
  <p>3rd:SEVERE-Unsecured objects will be tossed around. Food Service and walking is not possible, and is not advised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>*Consider that most turbulence is light and that moderate turbulence may feel like severe to the general public. However, actual severe turbulence is extremely rare and usually short in duration. The only potential danger in moderate to severe turbulence is to passengers and crew members who are not wearing their seat belt. So what happens when we encounter turbulence?</p>
<ul>
  <li>The pilots put the seat belt sign on - it is the safest for passengers to be secured in their seats. If conditions conducive to turbulence exist, the pilots will put the seat belt sign on advance (or keep it on for a longer period after takeoff) to ensure passenger safety. (Pilots wear their seat belts at all times while seated in the flight deck.)</li>
 
  <li>The pilot flying the aircraft will slow down if required, put less stress on the airframe. Similar to driving your car down a rough road. Your immediate reaction is to slow down. During the flight, the speed is only slightly slower than cruise speed, and may not be noticeable to passengers</li>

  <li>The pilots ask air traffic control if any other crews have reported less turbulence at different altitudes and requested a clearance to change to that altitude. On some days, this is not possible because the turbulence spans through wide ranges of altitudes, or because of other aircraft flying above or below.</li>

  <li>The cabin crew may modify or suspend in-flight service. If the turbulence is at a level where service would be difficult or even dangerous, the cabin crew may restrict serving hot beverages, or suspend service entirely and secure themselves with their seat belts.</li>

  <li>Passengers imagine dropping thousands of feet when in turbulence, however, from the pilot's perspective the actual altitude change is very minimal. After the passengers and the cabin crew are seated with their seat belts fastened, the main concern is to make sure that we don't spill our coffee!</li>
 
  <li>We do not fight the turbulence; in fact, some autopilots have a turbulence mode, which allows the plane to ride the waves as opposed to over reacting.</li>
