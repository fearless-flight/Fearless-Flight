<p>The takeoff is the beginning phase of flight and does not last more than a minute. Precise calculations, along with careful planning for the takeoff occur well before departure.</p>
<p>As safety is the backbone of aviation, the takeoff phase is no different. Precise performance calculations are made to ensure the takeoff will be conducted safely, even in the event of abnormal situations. This calculation is performed by taking the weight of the aircraft with the current weather conditions. A pre‚Äêplanned safety speed, known as a decision speed within the performance calculation is given to help provide pilots with sufficient stopping distance when speeding down the runway. If an abnormal situation occurs before this decision speed, the pilots can safely abort the takeoff and come to a complete stop.</p>
<p>If an aircraft reaches or passes the decision speed, the aircraft will not have the required distance to safely come to a complete stop. As a result, the takeoff would be continued and the emergency would be dealt with in the air. Even if, for example, an engine failure occurs past the posted decision speed, the aircraft is still very capable of performing the takeoff. The reason for this procedure is to help keep you and I safe by having the aircraft climb into the air for a planned return to the airport. Rest assured that all commercial pilots practice this scenario in a simulator on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The amount of power required for takeoff changes depending on certain conditions such as the weight of the aircraft, the runway distance available, and the current weather conditions. This is why the sound of the engine may be different from the last time you flew, even if you're flying on the same aircraft type.</p>
<p>After the aircraft 'rotates' (which basically means leaving the ground) the pilots look for what they call a 'positive rate.' This term is used to indicate that the aircraft is climbing away from the ground, and allows the pilots to safely bring the landing gear up. Doors used to cover the landing gear will open to allow the two main landing gear and front nose wheel into the belly of the aircraft (or, inside the engine compartment on some aircraft models.) Once inside, the gear doors will gently close to cover them for cruise flight. These mechanical actions may include a clunk sound. This is all normal.</p>
<p>After the wheels have been put away and the aircraft continues climbing out, you may hear or see the flaps retracting on the wings. The flaps are used both for takeoff and landing and are there to help change the shape of the wing to make it more effective at lower speeds by producing more lift. As the aircraft continues climbing out, it accelerates, and therefore no longer needs the help of the flaps. Different aircraft models may have mechanical noises associated with the movement of the flaps. This is normal.</p>
<p>The rate and angle of the climb out will depend on a number of factors including weather, noise abatement (meaning flying away from populated areas quickly to minimize noise pollution) and air traffic control procedures and instructions.</p>
