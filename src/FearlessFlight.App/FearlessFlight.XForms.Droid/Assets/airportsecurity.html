<p>When arriving at the airport you will see various things all around you to ensure the safety of the flying public. Although some find these things annoying, they are there to protect you and those around you. Airport security is there to prevent any dangerous situations from arising. The risk of any threat is greatly reduced due to the strict procedures in place.</p>
<p><em>Here's what to expect with airport security.</em></p>
<p><strong>Arriving at the airport</strong></p>
<p>When you check in at the counter, a customer service agent will need to see a passport or photo ID to make sure you are who you say you are. At certain times they will ask you a few simple questions such as:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1. Did you pack your bag yourself?<br />2. Was this bag left out of your sight?<br />3. Did anyone ask you to carry anything for them?<br />4. What is the address at your destination?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will then be directed to a security line where you will be required to throw out any water bottles and remove any liquids or gels from your carry on baggage.</p>
<p><strong>Going through security</strong></p>
<p>You may not carry on any liquids or gels that are in containers of more than 100ml; those with 100 ml or less must be placed in a provided clear plastic bag. Place this bag and your laptop as well as any coins, cell phones, bulky outerwear, and possibly your belt or anything else that would set off the metal detector, in the plastic bins. These items will travel through the X‐ray machine.</p>
<p>You will be asked to walk through a metal detector. If it beeps you may have to remove your shoes and try again or continue with additional screening.</p>
<p>When your luggage passes through the X‐ray machine, a specially trained person will look at the imagery to identify any high‐risk items that might need further investigation. If they would like to investigate further they will pull your bag to the side for further searching. This is normal.</p>
  <p>You also may be selected for additional random screening. This can be done in one of many of the ways listed below. This additional random screening is not optional but it will only take a few minutes of your time and may consist of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. A screening officer may use a hand wand device to detect metal objects on your person<br />2. A screening officer may conduct a full physical search (pat‐down) of your person. This is usually done off to the side by a same‐sex officer<br />3. A partial or full physical search of your carry‐on bag<br />4. A scan of the body using a full‐body scanner; and/or<br />5. Swabbing your computer or hands with a small cloth, which is then tested for traces of explosives</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once all of this is complete, be sure not to leave anything behind. Gather your belongings and continue to your gate.</p>
<p><strong>Waiting for your flight&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>While waiting for your flight, you may see security cameras and/or security officers walking through the airport. This is to help identify suspicious behaviors from any traveling passengers or other personnel in the airport. You may also notice that all access points to the bridges/gates are locked. Access is only granted to those with appropriate clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Airline Security Procedures</strong></p>
<p>Every airline in the world has strict security measures for all staff to follow. Security is one of the most important factors for all crew members to take very seriously every day. Safety is a top priority, and this includes the security of all passengers, aircraft, and crew. Rest assured that all pilots, cabin crew, and ground staff are all required to complete security training that enhances safety. Airlines also have independent security departments whose duty is to ensure security lapses do not occur.</p>
