           <p>Engines used on aircraft can be grouped into three basic categories: internal combustion (also referred to as 'piston engine'), jet (sometimes called 'turbo-fan'), and turbo-prop. An engine is selected during the design phase of an aircraft based on a number of factors, such as the desired power required, the weight that is practical for the aircraft to carry, and other factors more specific to the design purpose of the aircraft. Most pilots begin their flight training and early careers on smaller, lighter aircraft which primarily use piston engines. Most large commercial aircraft, much like the one you may be flying in, employ more modern, powerful, reliable, and efficient jet or turbo-prop engines. <br /> <br /> Jet engines are also much lighter, and use fewer moving parts than internal combustion engines. The trade-off for all these improvements is cost. Jet engines are far more expensive that equivalent piston engines, mainly because of the higher quality of the materials used in a jet engine, and the complexity of the required manufacturing and engineering.</p>
<p>Jet engines provide propulsion by mixing compressed atmospheric air with vaporized fuel, then igniting this mixture and capturing the energy of the resulting reaction by channelling the expanding, combusted air through a series of engine sections, called stages, before ejecting the air out of the back of the engine in a fast moving 'jet'. Before the air is exhausted, the stages inside the engine extract some of the inertia from the fast moving air to power a large circular fan at the front of the engine, which acts like a high-efficiency propeller. <br /> <br /> If there is a breeze, you often can see the fan at the front of the engine turning gently, allowing the sunlight to shine through the jet engine as the fan turns. Pilots call this 'wind-milling' and it is normal for the fan to be spinning slowly even if the engine is not operating. Often, the internal discs in a running Jet engine are moving at speeds in excess of 30,000 rpm (revolutions-per-minute). That's 500 complete rotations per second!</p>
<p>Turbo-prop engines use the same operating principles as jet engines, except they use the rotational power of the jet engine to drive a propeller at the front instead of a fan. The power-generating part of a turbo-prop engine is essentially a small jet engine, spinning at the same high speeds. Often, to the untrained-eye, it can be difficult to differentiate a turbo-prop from a piston engine. Some obvious differences are sound, and movement. <br /> <br /> A turbo-prop starts from the inside-out, meaning the jet proponent starts first (a gently intensifying whining sound can be heard) while the propeller initially sits motionless. As a turbo-prop starts up, the internal engine speed and temperature increases and the propeller gradually and smoothly begins to spin with increasing speed until it rests at a constant 'idle speed'. Conversely, an internal combustion engine sputters and the propeller jolts irregularly when starting, until the engine cranks rhythmically. The propeller movement is initially erratic as the engine chugs and coughs, until it too begins to run smoothly at idle power.</p>
<p>There are very specific and rigorous standards that aircraft engines need to meet in order to be cleared to fly. There are also various requirements based on the number of engines an aircraft uses. Most commonly, large commercial aircraft have two or more engines, mounted either under the wing, or on either side of the tail of the aircraft. One of the most basic of requirements for commercial aircraft is that if one of the engines fails at any phase of flight, the remaining operative engine(s) must be capable of powering the aircraft safely to a suitable airport. <br /> <br /> Although this type of event is rare, it does happen. It is an event that is carefully considered from early aircraft design through engine selection, and is a requirement for aircraft certification. Engine failures are also an integral part of pilot training, where engine failure scenarios are routinely and repetitively practiced in simulator sessions every year. Aircraft must not only be capable of experiencing a failed engine and continuing safely to a suitable airport, but they must be able have an engine fail at the most disadvantaged, vulnerable phase of flight: just prior to liftoff. <br /> <br /> This means that an aircraft's engines must be powerful enough that even if one fails, the remaining engine(s) is sufficient to climb the aircraft to a safe altitude and allow it to continue to cruise safely to a suitable airport. This scenario is discussed by the pilots as a part of their takeoff briefing before each and every flight. An engine failure is certainly an undesirable event, but it is an event that the aircraft is more than capable of recovering from and one that the pilots and cabin crew are well trained to deal with.</p>
