<p>While passengers are boarding, a number of things take place in and around the aircraft.</p>
<p>Outside, one of the pilots does a visual inspection to make sure the aircraft is safe for flight. The ramp staff load bags, connect the towbar (used to push the aircraft back from the gate when it is ready to depart) and may also be connecting or disconnecting ground power sources and heating and cooling carts. All of these things can be heard in the cabin usually as a thud or bang. At times the aircraft can move a bit with the loading of bags or the connection of the towbar. These sounds and movements are completely normal.</p>
<p>The cabin crew makes sure that all the passengers board the aircraft safely and that all baggage and personal items are the correct size and are stowed properly as per the civil aviation regulations. Safety briefings and safety checks occur at this time.</p>
<p>In the flight deck, the pilots perform a series of safety checks and calculations to get ready for the flight. The current weather is checked and the most into-wind runway is selected for departure. This is so that the aircraft has the best possible performance on takeoff. Takeoff speeds are calculated to ensure that specific performance criteria are met. The pilots plan the setup and programming of the planned route, requirement for deicing and contingency plans if something were to go wrong. (Pilots practice handling normal and emergency scenarios in the simulator every 6 months.) Checklists are carried out to ensure all tasks have been completed.</p>
<p>When all the passengers are on board, the Captain makes sure that the aircraft is properly loaded and within weight and balance limits. With this confirmation complete, the jet bridge (if used) is removed and the door is closed.</p>
<p>When all personnel have completed their duties and equipment is clear of the aircraft, the pilots start one of the engines. After the first engine is running, the ramp staff will disconnect the ground power source so that all of the aircraft systems are running on the power from the engine. The pilots get clearance from ground control to move away from the gate and the tug (tractor) will start to push the aircraft backwards. The remaining engine(s) may be started during push back, but in some cases (long taxi expected, for example) the pilots may delay subsequent engine starts to minimize fuel consumption. At some airports, a pushback is not required as there is enough room for the aircraft to turn away from the terminal building on its own power.</p>
<p>As the engines are started, cabin lights may cycle on and off due to different electrical systems come online. Heating and cooling air will start again. Hydraulic pumps (which control items such as the flaps and landing gear) are powered, and you may hear the pumps working as the pilots configure the aircraft for departure. (The characteristic sound of a hydraulic pump is a high pitched whine that may cycle high and low depending on the type of aircraft. This sound is much more noticeable on the ground than in the air.) Based on the previous performance calculations the flap setting is selected and an after start checklist is completed. With a clearance from ATC (Air Traffic Control) the airplane will taxi from the gate area to the deicing area or the runway via taxiways.</p>
<p>The airport is divided into many different areas. Airlines work on and around the apron/gate area (aircraft stands), taxiways, and runways.</p>
<p>The apron/gate area is the area where the airplanes are either connected by a bridge to the terminal building or where passengers can board or disembark from the aircraft into the terminal building. Gates most often are numbered sequentially.</p>
<p>Taxiways are designated roads or paths to allow aircraft to move around the airport. Taxiways are named by letters. The runways are the designated surfaces for takeoff and landing.</p>
<p>Runways are generally oriented in the direction of the prevailing winds where they are situated. Runways are named by numbers that correspond with their compass heading. For example, runway '36' is oriented in the direction of north, 360 degrees. A runway on an easterly heading would be '09' (090 degrees.) The other end of the runway is the opposite end of the compass, so the opposite of runway 09 is runway 27 or 270 degrees (west). Large airports that have two runways oriented in the same direction will also have an L (left) or R (right) as part of its name. An example is 04L and 04R.</p>
