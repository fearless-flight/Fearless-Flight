            <Label Text="When you check in at the counter, a customer service agent will need to see a passport or photo ID to make sure you are who you say you are. At certain times they will ask you a few simple questions such as:" />
            <Label Text="1. Did you pack your bag yourself?" />
            <Label Text="2. Was this bag left out of your sight?" />

Place this bag and your laptop as well as any coins, cell phones, bulky outerwear, and possibly your belt or anything else that would set off the metal detector, in the plastic bins. These items will travel through the X‐ray machine." />

            <Label Text="When your luggage passes through the X‐ray machine, a specially trained person will look at the imagery to identify any high‐risk items that might need further investigation. If they would like to investigate further they will pull your bag to the side for further searching. This is normal." />

            <Label Text="You also may be selected for additional random screening. This can be done in one of many of the ways listed below. This additional random screening is not optional but it will only take a few minutes of your time and may consist of the following:" />
            <Label Text="1. A screening officer may use a hand wand device to detect metal objects on your person" />
            <Label Text="2. A screening officer may conduct a full physical search (pat‐down) of your person. This is usually done off to the side by a same‐sex officer" />
            <Label Text="3. A partial or full physical search of your carry‐on bag" />
            <Label Text="4. A scan of the body using a full‐body scanner; and/or" />
            <Label Text="5. Swabbing your computer or hands with a small cloth, which is then tested for traces of explosives" />
